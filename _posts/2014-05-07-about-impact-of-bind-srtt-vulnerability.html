Hi,<br /><br />A recent <a href="http://thehackernews.com/2014/05/critical-vulnerability-in-bind-software.html">blog post</a>&nbsp;has misinterpreted or over-exaggerated a <a href="http://www.technion.ac.il/en/2014/04/students-reveal-loophole-in-dns-security/">press release</a> from the Technion.<br /><br />The <a href="http://bit.ly/19Gy734">BIND SRTT Vulnerability</a> that we discovered and presented in <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/woot13/workshop-program/presentation/hay">USENIX WOOT '13</a> is definitely <b>NOT</b>&nbsp;a critical security issue, which is exactly the reason why ISC has <a href="http://bit.ly/1beaBfJ">decided</a> to only fix it in a future version.<br /><br />So what is the real impact of the issue? As we stated in the <a href="http://bit.ly/19Gy734">whitepaper</a>&nbsp;and the <a href="http://bit.ly/15AdyZ4">slides</a>, the adversary can exploit this vulnerability in order to <i>optimize</i> off-path attacks by reducing a few bits of randomness. The vulnerability by itself <b>does NOT make&nbsp;</b>new attacks feasible.<br /><br />-Roee<br /><br /><br /><br />
