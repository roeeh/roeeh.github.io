Recently I detected a security vulnerability in Androidâ€™s SQLite engine which can be exploited by a non-privileged application in order to disclose sensitive information. It enables a malicious application to eavesdrop on database activities performed by any other application using SQLite, allowing unauthorized access to information such as URL history, messages, and contacts.<br /><br />The complete advisory can be found <a href="http://bit.ly/K0W0pT">here</a>.<br /><br />Demo of the PoC:<br /><iframe frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/oCXLHjmH5rY" width="420"></iframe>  <br /><br />I would like to thank the Android Security Team for the efficient and quick way in which they handled this security issue.
