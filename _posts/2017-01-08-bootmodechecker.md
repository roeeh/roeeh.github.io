I've justed uploaded to a [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=roeeh.bootmodechecker) & [GitHub](https://github.com/roeeh/bootmodechecker) a new app which checks whether your Nexus 6/6P device is still vulnerable to [CVE-2016-8467]. 
It also checks if the ro.boot.mode system property has been tampered with, which may indicate that the device is under attack.
Enjoy!
