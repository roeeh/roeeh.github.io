<p>Adobe just released a patch to a vulnerability I had reported to them.   <br />    <br />The issue is due to a lack of input validation which allows a specially crafted SWF file to cause Flash Player to perform an arbitrary memory read.</p>  <p>Exploiting the issue results in DoS (i.e crashes the browser). Further analysis might show it may lead to arbitrary code execution as well. </p>  <p>More details about it can be found in <a href="http://www.adobe.com/support/security/bulletins/apsb09-01.html">Adobe's security bulletin</a> (<a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0519">CVE-2009-0519</a>).     <br />    <br />I would like to thank Adobe for the efficient way in which they handled this security issue. </p>  <p>This update contains fixes to other vulnerabilities as well, so go update :)   </p>
